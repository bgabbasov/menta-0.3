User gets Invalid Login when trying to logon to Exampleproject. He has got a new password and changed it on the new ID page but it still does not work.
## Partly correct: 
Incorrect parts: 
     class Invalid_Login:
          def when_try():
               pass
               
          def get(new_password):
               pass
               
          def change(new_password, new_CDSID_page):
               pass
Those methods should be in class User.

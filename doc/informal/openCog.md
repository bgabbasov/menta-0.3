## OpenCog projects [see](http://opencog.org/projects/)

 1. [AtomSpace](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/AtomSpace) – an in-memory hypergraph store. Atoms, which can either be nodes or links, can be of a number of types and have a truth value associated with them.
 1. [PLN](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/PLN) – Probabilistic Logic Networks. An logic system for uncertain inference.
 1. [MOSES](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/PLN) – Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search. Program evolution based on representation-building and probabilistic modeling.
 1. [Embodiment](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Embodiment) – Modules to allow OpenCog to reason about being embodied within an avatar, be it a Nao robot or a game character inside a virtual world.
There are also a number of affiliated projects that are in separate repositories. These are often quite functional when used outside of the core framework.

 1. [RelEx](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/RelEx) and [Linkgrammar](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/) – Extract grammatical parses and semantic knowledge from natural language (in English).
 1. [NLGen](https://launchpad.net/nlgen) and [NLGen2](https://launchpad.net/nlgen2) – Do the inverse of RelEx. Convert semantic relationships to natural language.
… and more!

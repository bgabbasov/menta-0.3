Analysis of [OpenCog project](http://opencog.org/projects/)

## OpenCog projects [see](http://opencog.org/projects/)

 1. [AtomSpace](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/AtomSpace) – an in-memory hypergraph store. Atoms, which can either be nodes or links, can be of a number of types and have a truth value associated with them.
 1. [PLN](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/PLN) – Probabilistic Logic Networks. An logic system for uncertain inference.
 1. [MOSES](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/MOSES) – Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search. Program evolution based on representation-building and probabilistic modeling.
 1. [Embodiment](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Embodiment) – Modules to allow OpenCog to reason about being embodied within an avatar, be it a Nao robot or a game character inside a virtual world.
 1. [RelEx](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/RelEx) and [Linkgrammar](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/) – Extract grammatical parses and semantic knowledge from natural language (in English).
 1. [NLGen](https://launchpad.net/nlgen) and [NLGen2](https://launchpad.net/nlgen2) – Do the inverse of RelEx. Convert semantic relationships to natural language.

## Solution overall

### Definitions
[See Emotion Machine Solution Definitions section.](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/emotion-machine.md#Definitions)

### Analysis scope
Could the Solution produce the formalisation starting from Text to AnnotatedText according to [formalisation criteria](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/formalisation-criteria.md)?

## <a name="AtomSpace">AtomSpace</a>

### Analysis scope
Could the storage be reused in our project, are the AtomSpace is capable of storage Scala objects of our project: HowTo-s, Way2Think ...?

## <a name="Embodiment">Embodiment</a>
(Modules to allow OpenCog to reason about being embodied within an avatar the program in the computer environment world](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Embodiment) ([Intellix](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/intellix.md))

Embodiment system possibly could be used to simulate [Intellix](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/intellix.md).
### Definitions
[See Emotion Machine Solution Definitions section.](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/emotion-machine.md#Definitions)

### Analysis scope
Could the OpenCog agent produce the formalisation starting from Text to AnnotatedText according to [formalisation criteria](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/formalisation-criteria.md)?
Could the OpenCog agent learn, operate, experiment in [Intellix](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/intellix.md).

## <a name="RelEx">RelEx and Linkgrammar</a>
[RelEx](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/RelEx) and [Linkgrammar](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/)
RelEx Dependency Relationship Extractor

 1. Entry criteria = User provided new request.
 1. Exit criteria = Created structure of the text.
 1. Inbound data = a Text [see Component diagram section](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/annotation-interpretation-validation.md)
 1. Outbound data = a AnnotatedText with word links.

### Analysis scope
Could the RelEx produce the proper links structure of the text, suitable for further formalisation?

## <a name="NLGen">NLGen</a>
[NLGen](https://launchpad.net/nlgen) and [NLGen2](https://launchpad.net/nlgen2)
Do the inverse of RelEx. Convert semantic relationships to natural language.

 1. Entry criteria = System generated request to User.
 1. Exit criteria = Created natural language request.
 1. Inbound data = a AnnotatedText [see Component diagram section](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/informal/annotation-interpretation-validation.md#Component_diagram)
 1. Outbound data = a Text request.

### Analysis scope
Could the NLGen and/or NLGen2 produce the proper text of the request?

Main control lifecycle that starts perceiving workflow elements.

### Inbound data structure

Based on [Narrative Scripts/Stories](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/E8/eb8.html#_Toc518305131).

```
AnnotatedText extends Frames for Including Additional Slots {
   Narrative Story
   K-lines: List[Kline[Word, Concept]]
}
```

### Outbound data structure

```
Solution {
  Narrative Story[HowTo]
}
```

## Incident Classification Deliberate Critics

### Outbound data

```
Pair {
  Resource
  probability: Double
}
```

### Workflow

Following Critics started concurrently:

  1. Detect Direct instruction
  1. Detect Problem description
    2. Detect desired state in problem description

They end up with analysis results: Way2Think and probability pair.

## Selector chooses most probable variant according to Critics estimates, current example is _Problem description with desired state case_

## Problem description with desired state
see [alternative](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/analysis/perceiving-modelling.md#Direct_instruction_case)

## Simulation Way2Think with Problem model

### Outbound data structure

```
Semantic network[Concept]
```

### Workflow

  1. Reading each word
  1. via K-lines creates model(picture) of current state ex.:
    2. User: Actor
      3. has:
        4. Software
          5. name = Wordfinder
          5. version = Tehcnical
      3. ordered:
        4. Software
          5. name = Wordfinder
          5. version = Business Economical

### Exceptions

  1. Mandatory parameters of encapsulating concept was not detected => Clarification request for parameters to be clarified.

## Reformulation Way2Think with UserProblem model with desired state
see [alternative](https://github.com/menta/menta-0.3/blob/master/doc/analysis/perceiving-modelling.md#Reformulation_Way2Think_without_desired_state_case)

### Outbound data structure

```
Semantic network[Concept]
```

### Workflow

creates UserProblem model

  1. CurrentState
  1. DesiredState delta:
    2. software wrongly installed,
    2. software lack on the User computer.

### Exceptions

  1. Current state lacks what's wrong description
  1. System was unable to infer the desired state.

## Solution Generation Deliberate Critics searches among (KnowingHow Way2Think or ExtensiveSearch-es).

### Outbound data

```
Pair {
  Resource
  probability: Double
}
```

### Workflow

Following Critics started concurrently:

  1. Detect KnowingHow Way2Think to get from Current to Desired state
  1. Detect ExtensiveSearch if no complete Solution was generated

They end up with analysis results: Way2Think and probability pair.

## Selector chooses most probable variant according to Critics estimates of the completeness of the Solution, current example is _ExtensiveSearch_

### Inbound data

```
Pair {
  Resource
  probability: Double
}
```

### Outbound data

```
Resource
```

## ExtensiveSearch Way2Think
to get from CurrentState to DesiredState(_get rid of wrongly installed software, install desired software_).

  1. If found => reports success.
  1. If fails => activate Cry4Help Way2Think.

### Outbound data

```

  Narrative Story[HowTo]
}
```

### Exceptions

  1. Fails to find the HowTo to get rid of problem. => Escalate.

## Alternative workflow

Activates Simulation Way2Think with Instruction model.

## Simulation Way2Think with Instruction model

### Workflow
via K-lines creates model(picture) of current state with participants:

  1. Instruction HowTo
  1. Parameters of the Type set in HowTo

### Exceptions

  1. If Instruction HowTo was not found => Unknown action requested.
  1. If Instruction HowTo mandatory parameter of the specified type was not found => Clarification request for the parameter to be clarified.


## <a name="Reformulation_Way2Think_without_desired_state_case">Reformulation Way2Think with UserProblem model without desired state case</a>

### Workflow

  1. DesiredState is inferred taking in account following goals:
    2. System goal: to help user
    2. User goal: get rid of the problem
    2. Problem source analysis:
      3. If problem source mentioned explicitly (need Software) => DesiredState = Software installed ==> Install needed software
      3. Else initiate Deliberate Critics to find out the ProblemSource.)
  1. DesiredState delta
    2. software wrongly installed,
    2. software lack on the User computer.

### Exceptions

  1. Current state lacks what's wrong description
  1. System was unable to infer the desired state.

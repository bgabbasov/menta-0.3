Following feature may be interesting (for example to detect software names):

http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp/documentation/1.5.2-incubating/manual/opennlp.html#tools.namefind

Tried parsing issues. Performed following steps (the issues are in samples.txt):
1) First I separated sentences by the following command:

opennlp SentenceDetector en-sent.bin < samples.txt > samples-sent.txt

2) then I tokenized previous file:

opennlp TokenizerME en-token.bin < samples-sent.txt > samples-tokenized.txt

3) and then I parsed

opennlp Parser en-parser.bin en-parser-chunking.bin < samples-tokenized.txt > samples-parsed.txt

Below is results:

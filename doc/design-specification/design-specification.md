#Introduction

##Description of use

That is an applied formal methods in the context of Lexical  parsing of requirement engineering, incident – problem solving, and its troubleshooting   can be defined as methods that are relatively cheap compared to the manual requirement – incident- problem engineering as a whole (many human resources involved in that process).  The formal methods as such are not meant for creating (informal) requirements documents into formal documents, they are rather used to gradually validate requirements - incidents (obvious and implicit), explore essence of the matter of a requirements – incident document (problem-incident ticket, problem – incident report, analysis report and any). The goal of this approach is to have a usable low-cost, automated analysis – problem solving – resolution mechanism of natural language requirements.

## Main activities

The method defines a total of eight steps to perform the formal requirements validations.
The first three steps are the set-up steps.
The first step is to define a style, a structure and an English language specific domain vocabulary for the specific document which contains the requirements (Requirement Document, Problem – Incident document/ticket). The second step is to select the core parts (merit) of the document which the method should check. As described, the method is applicable on general linguistic and specific IT technical domain parts) of a document that are of interest. The third step is to look at which properties of the parts are satisfied for established accepting criteria’s or have missing some parts, require additional elucidation of the rule , of the text that have been selected in the second step, will be checked with which models approach.
All steps until eight are the production steps according SLA OLA procedures and project agreements, and can be iterated on at any stage. It should be noted that all those steps, are completely automatic.
Step four is the pre-processing step where the format, structure and ascertainment of all details, including project-domain specific, missing details (detected and added from KB) are translated to a canonical form so it can be used for further automatic processing.
Step five consists of the final parsing the natural language text into semantic content.
Step six is the step where the models that were chosen in step three are built (provided generated solution).
Step seven checks if the models and output result successfully check the properties of the content and sufficient for final acceptance.
And finally step eight, which is an ambitious step, consists of evaluating the findings and checking and correcting the requirement specification for incident fixing and delivering final report for incident realization by system itself or manually by assigned specialists.
